Step 1. Citations will be very important If I reference any material not part of the course material, I will usually start gathering my sources first and list them in my 
works cited section.

*Update I have been gathering resources, the works cited page should be in the readme file.  

Step 2. I want to have a functional menu system in this program, meaning one that doesn't close everytime I run a function.
to do this I'm planning to integrate a menu system from the start and build upon it.

*Update The program has a functional menu system currently chapters 1-5 have material I plan to keep adding to it.

Step 3. Research what I don't know how to do starting from ch1 and moving my way to ch11-ch14 (maybe ch15 too if possible) 
I will be reviewing and using some material I'm familiar with but learning/researching will be a big part of the latter 
part of the project.

*Update I have started with the easiest work material I'm already familiar with, there is still more research to be done.  

Step 4. Gather resources and information needed for implementing the neccesary functions and the imported modules they will require.
so far I know I will have to import the re module, the random module, the socket module, and the xml.etree.ElementTree as ET module

*Update So far I have not implemented any modules I have been working starting with ch1 as I go forward, modules will be added to the 
program as needed.

Step 5. Define functions and introduce/demo material in as subtle a way as I can, while still showing what I've learned.

*Update At this point Ch1-5 has material all of which is accessed via a menu system I have many user defined functions.
and will continue adding more 

Step 6. Presentation 
Once I have a program that is working to specifications, I will create a presentation of the program.
This would include a video Iâ€™m planning on pre-recording myself on zoom doing a screen capture / walkthrough of the program and adding that video to my final project material. 

I may include a voiced power point that demonstrates or explains the program if needed.

*Update For step 6 Presentation my plan is still the same, once the program is up to spec I will make a screen capture.
(I plan to use zoom and prerecord myself doing a walkthrough).
I will plan to upload that video to youtube.
A link to the youtube vid would be provided when it is up.

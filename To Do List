Step 1. Citations will be very important If I reference any material not part of the course material, I will usually start gathering my sources first and list them in my 
works cited section.

Step 2. I want to have a functional menu system in this program, meaning one that doesn't close everytime I run a function.
to do this I'm planning to integrate a menu system from the start and build upon it.

Step 3. Research what I don't know how to do starting from ch1 and moving my way to ch11-ch14 (maybe ch15 too if possible) 
I will be reviewing and using some material I'm familiar with but learning/researching will be a big part of the latter 
part of the project.

Step 4. Gather resources and information needed for implementing the neccesary functions and the imported modules they will require.
so far I know I will have to import the re module, the random module, the socket module, and the xml.etree.ElementTree as ET module  

Step 5. Define functions and introduce/demo material in as subtle a way as I can, while still showing what I've learned.

Step 6. Presentation 
Once I have a program that is working to specifications, I will create a presentation of the program.
This would include a video Iâ€™m planning on pre-recording myself on zoom doing a screen capture / walkthrough of the program and adding that video to my final project material. 

I may include a voiced power point that demonstrates or explains the program if needed.

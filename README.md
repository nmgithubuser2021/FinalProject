# FinalProject by Nicholas Mueller updated 4/27/2021
This project will be to show what I have learned through the semester with demonstrations of Python code.  
For the main idea of this project, I am planning to exhibit most of the concepts I have learned in as subtle a way as I can via a menu system organized with functions.
Also, for the project I plan to learn and demonstrate some of the material that didnâ€™t have a problem set. Such as material from ch11-15 of the textbook.

Note The following exercises were used for my Final Project program along with the youtube video tutorials.
